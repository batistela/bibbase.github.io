abstract = {Stevioside, a glycoside present in the leaves of the plant, Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni (SrB), has acute insulinotropic effects in vitro. Its potential antihyperglycemic and blood pressure-lowering effects were examined in a long-term study in the type 2 diabetic Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat. Rats were fed 0.025 g.kg-1d-1 of stevioside (purity {\textgreater} 99.6{\%}) for 6 weeks. An intra-arterial catheter was inserted into the rats after 5 weeks, and conscious rats were subjected to arterial glucose tolerance test (2.0 g.kg-1) during week 6. Stevioside had an antihyperglycemic effect (incremental area under the glucose response curve [IAUC]): 985 ?? 20 (stevioside) versus 1,575 ?? 21 (control) mmol/L ?? 180 minutes, (P {\textless} .05), it enhanced the first-phase insulin response (IAUC: 343 ?? 33 [stevioside] v 136 ?? 24 [control] ??U/mL insulin ?? 30 minutes, P {\textless} .05) and concomitantly suppressed the glucagon levels (total AUC: 2,026 ?? 234 [stevioside] v 3,535 ?? 282 [control] pg/mL ?? 180 minutes, P {\textless} .05). In addition, stevioside caused a pronounced suppression of both the systolic (135 ?? 2 v 153 ?? 5 mm Hg; P {\textless} .001) and the diastolic blood pressure (74 ?? 1 v 83 ?? 1 mm Hg; P {\textless} .001). Bolus injections of stevioside (0.025 g.kg-1) did not induce hypoglycemia. Stevioside augmented the insulin content in the ??-cell line, INS-1. Stevioside may increase the insulin secretion, in part, by induction of genes involved in glycolysis. It may also improve the nutrient-sensing mechanisms, increase cytosolic long-chain fatty acyl-coenzyme A (CoA), and downregulate phosphodiesterase 1 (PDE1) estimated by the microarray gene chip technology. In conclusion, stevioside enjoys a dual positive effect by acting as an antihyperglycemic and a blood pressure-lowering substance; effects that may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome.

abstract = {Patients with obesity are susceptible to hypertension. We have reported that the plasma adiponectin levels are decreased in obesity and that adiponectin has many defensive properties against obesity-related diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between adiponectin and hypertension in mice. We measured blood pressure and heart rate directly by a catheter in the carotid artery and indirectly by automatic sphygmomanometer at the tail artery. Obese KKAy mice had significantly lower plasma adiponectin levels and higher systolic blood pressure than control C57BL/6J mice at 21 weeks of age. Adenovirus-delivered adiponectin significantly decreased blood pressure in KKAy mice. The direct role of adiponectin on blood pressure regulation under insulin resistance-free state was investigated in adiponectin-knockout (KO) mice. Adiponectin KO mice developed hypertension when maintained on a high-salt diet (8{\%} NaCl) without insulin resistance. The hypertension of salt-fed adiponectin KO mice was associated with reduced mRNA levels of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and prostaglandin I(2) synthase in aorta and low metabolite levels of endothelial NO synthase and prostaglandin I(2) synthase in plasma. Adiponectin therapy lowered the elevated blood pressure and corrected the above mRNA levels to those of the wild type. Our results suggest that hypoadiponectinemia contributes to the development of obesity-related hypertension, at least in part, directly, in addition to its effect via insulin resistance, and that adiponectin therapy can be potentially useful for hypertension in patients with the metabolic syndrome.},

abstract = {A chronic minor imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure may lead to obesity. Both lean and obese subjects eventually reach energy balance and their body weight regulation implies that the adipose tissue mass is "sensed", leading to appropriate responses of energy intake and energy expenditure. The cloning of the ob gene and the identification of its encoded protein, leptin, have provided a system signaling the amount of adipose energy stores to the brain. Leptin, a hormone secreted by fat cells, acts in rodents via hypothalamic receptors to inhibit feeding and increase thermogenesis. A feedback regulatory loop with three distinct steps has been identified: (1) a sensor (leptin production by adipose cells) monitors the size of the adipose tissue mass; (2) hypothalamic centers receive and integrate the intensity of the leptin signal through leptin receptors (LRb); (3) effector systems, including the sympathetic nervous system, control the two main determinants of energy balance-energy intake and energy expenditure. While this feedback regulatory loop is well established in rodents, there are many unsolved questions about its applicability to body weight regulation in humans. The rate of leptin production is related to adiposity, but a large portion of the interindividual variability in plasma leptin concentration is independent of body fatness. Gender is an important factor determining plasma leptin, with women having markedly higher leptin concentrations than men for any given degree of fat mass. The ob mRNA expression is also upregulated by glucocorticoids, whereas stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system results in its inhibition. Furthermore, leptin is not a satiety factor in humans because changes in food intake do not induce short-term increases in plasma leptin levels. After its binding to LRb in the hypothalamus, leptin stimulates a specific signaling cascade that results in the inhibition of several orexigenic neuropeptides, while stimulating several anorexigenic peptides. The orexigenic neuropeptides that are downregulated by leptin are NPY (neuropeptide Y), MCH (melanin-concentrating hormone), orexins, and AGRP (agouti-related peptide). The anorexigenic neuropeptides that are upregulated by leptin are alpha-MSH (alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone), which acts on MC4R (melanocortin-4 receptor); CART (cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript); and CRH (corticotropin-releasing-hormone). Obese humans have high plasma leptin concentrations related to the size of adipose tissue, but this elevated leptin signal does not induce the expected responses (i.e., a reduction in food intake and an increase in energy expenditure). This suggests that obese humans are resistant to the effects of endogenous leptin. This resistance is also shown by the lack of effect of exogenous leptin administration to induce weight loss in obese patients. The mechanisms that may account for leptin resistance in human obesity include a limitation of the blood-brain-barrier transport system for leptin and an inhibition of the leptin signaling pathways in leptin-responsive hypothalamic neurons. During periods of energy deficit, the fall in leptin plasma levels exceeds the rate at which fat stores are decreased. Reduction of the leptin signal induces several neuroendocrine responses that tend to limit weight loss, such as hunger, food-seeking behavior, and suppression of plasma thyroid hormone levels. Conversely, it is unlikely that leptin has evolved to prevent obesity when plenty of palatable foods are available because the elevated plasma leptin levels resulting from the increased adipose tissue mass do not prevent the development of obesity. In conclusion, in humans, the leptin signaling system appears to be mainly involved in maintenance of adequate energy stores for survival during periods of energy deficit. Its role in the etiology of human obesity is only demonstrated in the very rare situations of absence of the leptin signal (mutations of the leptin gene or of the leptin receptor gene), which produces an internal perception of starvation and results in a chronic stimulation of excessive food intake.},

abstract = {??-l-Glucose pentaacetate, but not ??-d-galactose pentaacetate, was recently reported to taste bitter and to stimulate insulin release. This finding led, in the present study, to the investigation of the effects of both bitter and non-bitter artificial sweeteners on insulin release and cationic fluxes in isolated rat pancreatic islets. Sodium saccharin (1.0-10.0 mM), sodium cyclamate (5.0-10.0 mM), stevioside (1.0 mM) and acesulfame-K (1.0-15.0 mM), all of which display a bitter taste, augmented insulin release from islets incubated in the presence of 7.0 mM d-glucose. In contrast, aspartame (1.0-10.0 mM), which is devoid of bitter taste, failed to affect insulin secretion. A positive secretory response to acesulfame-K was still observed when the extracellular K+ concentration was adjusted to the same value as that in control media. No major changes in 86Rb and 45Ca outflow from pre-labelled perifused islets could be attributed to the saccharin, cyclamic or acesulfame anions. It is proposed that the insulinotropic action of some artificial sweeteners and, possibly, that of selected hexose pentaacetate esters may require G-protein-coupled receptors similar to those operative in the recognition of bitter compounds by taste buds.

abstract = {Insulin resistance is increasingly recognized as a chronic, low-level, inflammatory state. Hyperinsulinemia and insulin action were initially proposed as the common preceding factors of hypertension, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, hypertriglyceridemia, abdominal obesity, and altered glucose tolerance, linking all these abnormalities to the development of coronary heart disease. The similarities of insulin resistance with another inflammatory state, atherosclerosis, have been described only in the last few decades. Atherosclerosis and insulin resistance share similar pathophysiological mechanisms, mainly due to the actions of the two major proinflammatory cytokines, TNF-alpha and IL-6. Genetic predisposition to increased transcription rates of these cytokines is associated with metabolic derangement and simultaneously with coronary heart disease. Dysregulation of the inflammatory axis predicts the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The knowledge of how interactions between metabolic and inflammatory pathways occur will be useful in future therapeutic strategies. The effective administration of antiinflammatory agents in the treatment of insulin resistance and atherosclerosis is only the beginning of a promising approach in the management of these syndromes.},

abstract = {Stevioside is present in the plant Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni (SrB). Extracts of SrB have been used for the treatment of diabetes in, for example, Brazil, although a positive effect on glucose metabolism has not been unequivocally demonstrated. We studied the acute effects of Stevioside in type 2 diabetic patients. We hypothesize that supplementation with stevioside to a test meal causes a reduction in postprandial blood glucose. Twelve type 2 diabetic patients were included in an acute, paired cross-over study. A standard test meal was supplemented with either 1 g of stevioside or 1 g of maize starch (control). Blood samples were drawn at 30 minutes before and for 240 minutes after ingestion of the test meal. Compared to control, stevioside reduced the incremental area under the glucose response curve by 18{\%} (P = .013). The insulinogenic index (AUCi,insulin/AUCi,glucose) was increased by approximately 40{\%} by stevioside compared to control (P {\textless} .001). Stevioside tended to decrease glucagon levels, while it did not significantly alter the area under the insulin, glucagon-like peptide 1, and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide curves. In conclusion, stevioside reduces postprandial blood glucose levels in type 2 diabetic patients, indicating beneficial effects on the glucose metabolism. Stevioside may be advantageous in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The study was designed to evaluate the chronic regulation of plasma leptin by dietary (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in insulin-resistant, sucrose-fed rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to consume for 3 or 6 wk a diet containing 57.5{\%} (g/100 g) sucrose and 14{\%} lipids as either fish oil (SF) or control oils (SC). After 3 and 6 wk of consuming the SF diet, plasma leptin was 70{\%} (P {\textless} 0.001) and 75{\%} (P {\textless} 0.05) greater, respectively, than in rats fed the SC diet. The same result was found when plasma leptin was adjusted by total fat mass, as measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Despite high leptin levels, food intake of rats fed the SF diet was greater than in SC-fed rats without any difference in body weight or total fat mass. After 3 wk, accumulated leptin in epididymal and retroperitoneal adipose tissue was higher in the SF-fed rats than in the SC-fed rats. However, after 6 wk, tissue leptin in the SF-fed rats did not differ from that of the SC-fed rats. The SF diet increased adipose tissue glucose transporter-4 protein quantity and prevented the sucrose-induced elevations in plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids. When all SC- and SF-fed rats (both diets and feeding durations) were considered, plasma leptin levels were positively correlated with body weight (r = 0.5, P {\textless} 0.0001) and with total fat mass (r = 0.5, P {\textless} 0.0005). These results suggest that plasma leptin at a given time could be inappropriately high for a given fat mass in insulin-sensitive rats fed (n-3) PUFA.

abstract = {Obesity represents a major threat to health and quality of life. Although obesity has strong genetic determinants, the increasing prevalence of obesity in populations around the world suggests that environmental factors are promoting or exacerbating the problem. Experts are calling for public health efforts to deal with the global epidemic of obesity. Such a campaign would require that we identify and modify environmental factors that promote obesity. Our current food supply is high in fat, and high fat diets have been suggested to promote obesity by increasing energy intake, thus increasing the probability of positive energy balance and weight gain. However, others argue that high fat diets are not promoting obesity. In this paper, we review evidence from animal studies, carefully controlled laboratory studies, cross-sectional studies, clinical trials and studies in individuals at high risk to develop obesity. Although there are many environmental factors promoting excess energy intake and discouraging energy expenditure, it is clear that consumption of a high fat diet increases the likelihood of obesity and that the risk of obesity is low in individuals consuming low fat diets. On the basis of the available data, the current public health recommendations to lower dietary fat intake appear to be appropriate.},

abstract = {Age-dependent changes in insulin action and body fat distribution are risk factors for the development of type 2 diabetes. To examine whether the accumulation of visceral fat (VF) could play a direct role in the pathophysiology of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, we monitored insulin action, glucose tolerance, and the expression of adipo-derived peptides after surgical removal of VF in aging (20-month-old) F344/Brown Norway (FBN) and in Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats. As expected, peripheral and hepatic insulin action were markedly impaired in aging FBN rats, and extraction of VF (accounting for approximately 18{\%} of their total body fat) was sufficient to restore peripheral and hepatic insulin action to the levels of young rats. When examined at the mechanistic level, removal of VF in ZDF rats prevented the progressive decrease in insulin action and delayed the onset of diabetes, but VF extraction did not alter plasma free fatty acid levels. However, the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and leptin in subcutaneous (SC) adipose tissue were markedly decreased after VF removal (by approximately three- and twofold, respectively). Finally, extracted VF retained approximately 15-fold higher resistin mRNA compared with SC fat. Our data suggest that insulin resistance and the development of diabetes can be significantly reduced in aging rats by preventing the age-dependent accumulation of VF. This study documents a cause-and-effect relationship between VF and major components of the metabolic syndrome.},

abstract = {The percentage of energy from dietary fat is widely believed to be an important determinant of body fat, and several mechanisms have been proposed to account for such a relation. Comparisons of both diets and the prevalence of obesity between affluent and poor countries have been used to support a causal association, but these contrasts are seriously confounded by differences in physical activity and food availability. Within areas of similar economic development, regional intake of fat and prevalence of obesity have not been positively correlated. Randomized trials are the preferable method to evaluate the effect of dietary fat on adiposity, and are feasible because the number of subjects needed is not large. In short-term trials, a modest reduction in body weight is typically seen in individuals randomly assigned to diets with a lower percentage of energy from fat. However, compensatory mechanisms appear to operate because in trials lasting {\textgreater} or = 1 y, fat consumption within the range of 18-40{\%} of energy appears to have little if any effect on body fatness. Moreover, within the United States, a substantial decline in the percentage of energy from fat consumed during the past two decades has corresponded with a massive increase in obesity. Diets high in fat do not appear to be the primary cause of the high prevalence of excess body fat in our society, and reductions in fat will not be a solution.},

To orchestrate the processes of energy storage and release, highly integrated systems operating on several physiological levels have evolved. The adipocyte is no longer considered a passive bystander, because fat cells actively secrete many members of the cytokine family, such as leptin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-6, among other cytokine signals, which influence peripheral fuel storage, mobilization, and combustion, as well as energy homeostasis. The existence of a network of adipose tissue signaling pathways, arranged in a hierarchical fashion, constitutes a metabolic repertoire that enables the organism to adapt to a wide range of different metabolic challenges, such as starvation, stress, infection, and short periods of gross energy excess.},

Stevia rebaudiana Bert. leaves produce high concentrations of diterpene steviol glycosides and should be a rich source of transcripts involved in diterpene synthesis. In order to create a resource for gene discovery and increase our understanding of steviol glycoside biosynthesis, we sequenced 5,548 ESTs from a S. rebaudiana leaf cDNA library. The EST collection was fully annotated based on database search results. ESTs involved in diterpene synthesis were identified using published sequences as electronic probes, by keyword searches of search results, and by differential representation. A significant portion of the ESTs were specific for standard leaf metabolic pathways; energy and primary metabolism represented 17.6{\%} and 13.1{\%} of total transcripts respectively. Diterpene metabolism in S. rebaudiana represented 1.1{\%} of total transcripts. This study identified candidate genes for 70{\%} of the known steps in the steviol glycoside pathway. One candidate, kaurene oxidase, was the 8th most abundant EST in the collection. Identification of many candidate genes specific to the I -deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate pathway suggests that the primary source of isopentenyl diphosphate, a precursor of geranylgeranyl diphosphate, is via the non-mevalonic acid pathway. The use of ESTs has greatly facilitated the identification of candidate genes and increased our understanding of diterpene metabolism.},

abstract = {Obesity is increasing in an epidemic manner in most countries and constitutes a public health problem by enhancing the risk for cardiovascular disease and metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes. Owing to the increase in obesity, life expectancy may start to decrease in developed countries for the first time in recent history. The factors determining fat mass in adult humans are not fully understood, but increased lipid storage in already developed fat cells (adipocytes) is thought to be most important. Here we show that adipocyte number is a major determinant for the fat mass in adults. However, the number of fat cells stays constant in adulthood in lean and obese individuals, even after marked weight loss, indicating that the number of adipocytes is set during childhood and adolescence. To establish the dynamics within the stable population of adipocytes in adults, we have measured adipocyte turnover by analysing the integration of 14C derived from nuclear bomb tests in genomic DNA. Approximately 10{\%} of fat cells are renewed annually at all adult ages and levels of body mass index. Neither adipocyte death nor generation rate is altered in early onset obesity, suggesting a tight regulation of fat cell number in this condition during adulthood. The high turnover of adipocytes establishes a new therapeutic target for pharmacological intervention in obesity.},

abstract = {Most epidemiological studies indicate that obesity is more prevalent in populations consuming high fat diets. Furthermore, changes from a traditional to a westernized life style, characterized by a high-fat diet and decreased physical activity, result in dramatic increases in the prevalence and incidence of obesity in Native Americans, Pacific Islanders, and African populations. A possible explanation for the epidemic of obesity in response to high-fat intake can be found in the "oxidative hierarchy" that regulates macronutrient balance in the human body. Although carbohydrate and protein balances seem promptly regulated, fat balance is not. Short and midterm studies show that, unlike carbohydrate and protein intake, fat intake does not promote fat oxidation. Thus, "excess" fat intake results in fat deposition. As fat mass increases, so does fat oxidation, and a new equilibrium is reached when fat oxidation matches fat intake. However, there are large interindividual differences in this compensatory response to increased fat intake. Substrate oxidation is a familial trait, and individuals with a low fat-to-carbohydrate oxidation ratio are more prone to develop obesity than those with a high fat-to-carbohydrate oxidation ratio. Genetics may influence nutrient partitioning by influencing the activity of key enzymes of intermediate metabolism, such as lipoprotein lipase, beta-hydroxyl acyl CoA dehydrogenase, and acetyl CoA carboxylase.},

abstract = {The search for the causes of obesity has involved genetic abnormalities and endocrine and neural lesions. Although evidence suggests that genetics plays an important role in body weight regulation, rapid increases in obesity rates do not seem to be caused by significant genetic changes within populations. Total energy expenditure and total energy intake are not the only factors that regulate body fat. Nitrogen and carbohydrate balances are eased by the capacity of the organism for adjusting amino acids and glucose oxidation rates, respectively. Regarding fat, this mechanism is considerably less precise; a fat intake increase does not stimulate its oxidation on the same basis. In addition, dietary fat is stored very efficiently as body fat. Elevated carbohydrate ingestion enhances glycogen reserves, which usually are much smaller than the maximum capacity of storage and enlargement of these stores, thus stimulating this nutrient's oxidation. These data point to a very well controlled carbohydrate balance in the body. Various studies show lack of efficiency of the hyperlipidic diet in stimulating satiety. Signals arising from the gastrointestinal tract play a fundamental role in regulation of appetite and energy intake, and evidence indicates that the gastrointestinal and hormonal mechanisms involved in the suppression of appetite and in energy intake are compromised in obesity. A high-fat diet is important in its origin. Additional studies are necessary to explain the mechanisms that lead to adipose tissue retention resulting in a fat-rich diet.},

abstract = {The sterility of male and female homozygous ob/ob mice is a recognized feature of the ob mutation (1). Whereas ob/ob males can occasionally reproduce if maintained on a restricted diet, ob/ob females are always sterile (2). Thinning of the ob/ob females to normal weight by diet-restriction failed to correct their sterility. Early sexual development is normal in ob/ob females; however, ovulation never follows and the mice remain prepuberal indefinitely with no occurrence of oestrus cycles. Reproductive hormones are reduced in ob/ob females (3) demonstrating a functional defect from the hypothalamic-pituitary axis (4-6). The ovaries of ob/ob females are capable of producing viable eggs when transplanted into lean female recipients (7). Reconstitution of reproductive functions in the ob/ob female necessitates delivery of hypothalamic extracts to the third ventricle (8) and administration of pituitary extract (9), gonadotropic hormones (10), progesterone (11) and relaxin (12). These previous findings demonstrate that the sterility of ob/ob females is caused by an insufficiency of hormones at the hypothalamic-pituitary level rather than physical hindrance of copulatory activity, pregnancy and parturition caused by excess adipose tissue. We show here that repeated administration of only the recombinant human ob protein, leptin, into homozygous female ob/ob mice can correct their sterility, thus resulting in ovulation, pregnancy and parturition.},

With lipectomy of {\textgreater}50{\%} of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SQAT) in nonhibernating, adult female Syrian hamsters on high-fat (HF; 50 calorie{\%}) diet and measurements of oral glucose tolerance, oral [(14)C]oleic acid disposal, serum triglycerides, serum leptin, liver fat, perirenal (PR) adipose tissue cellularity, and body composition, we studied the role of SQAT. Sham-operated (S) animals on HF or low-fat (LF; 12.5 calorie{\%}) diets served as controls. After 3 mo there was no visible regrowth of SQAT but HF diet led to similar levels of body weight and body fat in lipectomized and sham-operated animals. Lipectomized (L) animals had more intra-abdominal fat as a percentage of total body fat, higher insulinemic index, a strong trend toward increased liver fat content, and markedly elevated serum triglycerides compared with S-HF and S-LF. Liver and PR adipose tissue uptake of fatty acid were similar in L-HF and S-HF but reduced vs. S-LF, and were inversely correlated with liver fat content and insulin sums during the oral glucose tolerance test. In summary, lipectomy of SQAT led to compensatory fat accumulation implying regulation of total body fat mass. In conjunction with HF diet these lipectomized hamsters developed a metabolic syndrome with significant hypertriglyceridemia, relative increase in intra-abdominal fat, and insulin resistance. We propose that SQAT, via disposal and storage of excess ingested energy, acts as a metabolic sink and protects against the metabolic syndrome of obesity.},

abstract = {The regulation of body weight and composition involves input from genes and the environment, demonstrated, for example, by the variable susceptibility of inbred strains of mice to obesity when offered a high-fat diet. The identification of the gene responsible for obesity in the ob/ob mouse provides a new approach to defining links between diet and genetics in the regulation of body weight. The ob gene protein product, leptin, is an adipocyte-derived circulating protein. Administration of recombinant leptin reduces food intake and increases energy expenditure in ob/ob mice, suggesting that it signals to the brain the magnitude of fat stores. Information on the regulation of this protein is limited. In several rodent models of obesity including db/db, fa/fa, yellow (Ay/a) VMH-lesioned, and those induced by gold thioglucose, monosodium glutamate, and transgenic ablation of brown adipose tissue, leptin mRNA expression and the level of circulating leptin are increased, suggesting resistance to one or more of its actions. We have assessed the impact of increased dietary fat on circulating leptin levels in normal FVB mice and FVB mice with transgene-induced ablation of brown adipose tissue. We find that high-fat diet evokes a sustained increase in circulating leptin in both normal and transgenic mice, with leptin levels accurately reflecting the amount of body lipid across a broad range of body fat. However, despite increased leptin levels, animals fed a high-fat diet became obese without decreasing their caloric intake, suggesting that a high content of dietary fat changes the 'set point' for body weight, at least in part by limiting the action of leptin.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on the effects of dietary fats or fatty acids on key targets of metabolic intermediates for body-weight control, i.e. satiety, thermogenesis, fat oxidation and body composition. With respect to sensory satiety, it appeared, e.g. that linoleic acid tasters showed a different mechanism for meal termination than non-tasters did. They stopped eating linoleic acid containing food based upon satiety, whereas the non-tasters stopped eating based upon the change in pleasantness of taste. Moreover, in the normal range of body mass index, an inverse relationship was shown between {\%} 'tasters' and BMI. In a high fat diet vs. a low fat high protein high carbohydrate diet, metabolic satiety appeared to be continuously lower and correlated positively to diet-induced energy expenditure. However, with respect to the intermeal interval, satiety appeared to be more sustained following a high fat vs. a high CHO preload, resulting in a lower meal frequency. Covert fat replacement during breakfast by sucrose polyester was successful in combination with dietary restraint, yet overt fat replacement in snacks was successful in the dietary-unrestrained subjects, i.e. those who habitually ate snacks. With respect to fat oxidation, from a respiration-chamber experiment on the effects of diacylglycerol compared (DG) to triacylglycerol (TG) intake, it was concluded that consumption of DG increased fat oxidation and beta-hydroxy-butyrate levels, but did not affect energy metabolism or triacylglycerol level. Parameters of appetite were all lowered by DG compared to TG. With respect to body composition, the effects of 13 weeks CLA supplementation in overweight subjects during weight regain were assessed. Although CLA did not affect {\%}body-weight regain, the regain of fat-free mass was increased by CLA, independently of {\%}body-weight regain and physical activity, and as a consequence resting metabolic rate was increased. At the same time, appetite was reduced and satiety and fullness were increased. In conclusion, we also determined bright sports with respect to fat intake.},

@article{West1998,
abstract = {This review focuses on animal studies that examine the role of dietary fat in obesity. It is evident from animal experiments that the percentage of energy derived from fat in the diet is positively correlated with body fat content. With few exceptions, obesity is induced by high-fat diets in monkeys, dogs, pigs, hamsters, squirrels, rats, and mice. The mechanisms responsible for this correlation between body fat and dietary fat content are not clear. It has been proposed that a high-fat diet produces hyperphagia, which is solely responsible for the increased body fat content. However, several studies in various rodent models showed that increased body fat content still results when the hyperphagia is prevented. This suggests that some metabolic effects of high-fat diets, independent of hyperphagia, may also be contributing to the obesity induced by high-fat diets. It is also clear from animal studies that genetic factors significantly modulate the body's response to diets high in fat-derived energy. In contrast with the animal studies, studies in humans that have examined the relation between dietary fat content and body fat are inconclusive. The limitations of cross-sectional studies, the lack of controlled feeding trials, and the importance of genetic variation in response explain the absence of conclusive evidence. The lessons learned from animal models point to dietary fat as one potentially important component in the etiology of human obesity. Additional comprehensive studies are warranted to determine the role of dietary fat in the etiology of human obesity.},

@article{Defronzo2004,
abstract = {Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion. Considerable evidence implicates altered fat topography and defects in adipocyte metabolism in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. In individuals who develop type 2 diabetes, fat cells tend to be enlarged. Enlarged fat cells are resistant to the antilipolytic effects of insulin, leading to day-long elevated plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels. Chronically increased plasma FFA stimulates gluconeogenesis, induces hepatic and muscle insulin resistance, and impairs insulin secretion in genetically predisposed individuals. These FFA-induced disturbances are referred to as lipotoxicity. Enlarged fat cells also have diminished capacity to store fat. When adipocyte storage capacity is exceeded, lipid ‘overflows' into muscle and liver, and possibly the $\beta$-cells of the pancreas, exacerbating insulin resistance and further impairing insulin secretion. In addition, dysfunctional fat cells produce excessive amounts of insulin resistance-inducing, inflammatory and atherosclerosis-provoking cytokines, and fail to secrete normal amounts of insulin-sensitizing cytokines. As more evidence emerges, there is a stronger case for targeting adipose tissue in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor $\gamma$ (PPAR$\gamma$) agonists, for example the thiazolidinediones, redistribute fat within the body (decrease visceral and hepatic fat; increase subcutaneous fat) and have been shown to enhance adipocyte insulin sensitivity, inhibit lipolysis, reduce plasma FFA and favourably influence the production of adipocytokines. This article examines in detail the role of adipose tissue in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and highlights the potential of PPAR agonists to improve the management of patients with the condition.},

abstract = {In vitro studies of adipocytes taken from different body fat regions suggest substantial differences in lipolysis between intra-abdominal, lower-body subcutaneous, and abdominal subcutaneous regions. Gender and obesity appear to influence these regional differences. In situ measurements of glycerol release from adipose tissue provided further evidence that regional heterogeneity of lipolysis occurs in humans. In vivo studies of regional free fatty acid (FFA) release have confirmed that adipose tissue lipolysis varies between upper- and lower-body fat. Release of FFA from lower-body adipose tissue is less than that from upper-body adipose tissue in both obese and non-obese men and women. In non-obese men and women, meal ingestion suppresses FFA release from all adipose tissue regions, and adrenergic stimulation activated FFA release from different sites in a gender-specific fashion. Significant regional and gender differences in adipose tissue lipolysis occur in humans, and this could contribute to differences in the health effects of adipose tissue and could theoretically influence body fat distribution.},

abstract = {The effect of aqueous extracts of Stevia rebaudiana leaves on a glucose tolerance test was investigated in 16 normal volunteers. Aqueous extracts of 5 grams of leaves were administered to volunteers at regular 6-h intervals for 3 days. Glucose tolerance tests were performed before and after extract administration. A second group of 6 normal volunteers who ingested an aqueous arabinose solution was also studied to eliminate possible stress effects. The extract of Stevia rebaudiana increased glucose tolerance. The extract significantly decreased plasma glucose levels during the test and after overnight fasting in all volunteers.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Leptin is produced in proportion to body fat mass and can act on the brain to induce satiety and regulate adipose tissue mass; factors other than adipose tissue mass may influence circulating leptin concentrations. OBJECTIVE: We explored the possibility that short-term, moderately high-fat diets induce weight gain by producing inappropriately low circulating leptin concentrations. DESIGN: Female Hooded Wistar rats were fed either a moderately high-fat diet or control diet. Body weight, energy intake, body composition, and fasting plasma leptin were compared after 4 and 14 wk of dietary treatment. RESULTS: After 4 wk, abdominal fat mass was 38{\%} greater in rats fed the high-fat diet than in those fed the control diet (P {\textless} 0.01). However, plasma leptin concentrations were 24{\%} lower in animals fed the high-fat diet (P {\textless} 0.05), resulting in significantly lower plasma leptin concentrations per unit abdominal fat mass than in control animals (P {\textless} 0.005). From 4 to 14 wk, animals fed the high-fat diet gained twice as much weight and consumed 32 kJ/d more than controls (both P {\textless} 0.05). At 14 wk, plasma leptin concentrations per unit abdominal fat mass were 27{\%} lower in rats fed the high-fat diet (P = 0.058) and there was a significant negative association between leptin concentrations per unit abdominal fat mass and body weight (r = 0.44, P {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In the short term, a moderately high-fat diet is associated with lower than expected circulating leptin concentrations, which correlate with a higher body weight. A high-fat diet may therefore contribute to weight gain by reducing leptin secretion in adipose tissue.},

abstract = {5-Azacytidine converts the mouse embryonic cell line C3H10T1/2 into differentiated chondrocytes, adipocytes, and skeletal muscle. Clonal and 2D protein gel analyses demonstrate that 5-azacytidine converts 10T1/2 cells into three stably determined, but undifferentiated, stem cell lineages which can differentiate into myofibers, chondrocytes, and adipocytes. Conversion of 10T1/2 cells is accompanied by specific changes in protein synthetic patterns unique for each cell lineage. We propose that 5-azacytidine converts 10T1/2 cells by hypomethylation of "determination" regulatory loci which establish lineages of stem cells with a restricted potential to differentiate into muscle, cartilage, or fat cells. Our results suggest that these three lineages are specified by separate regulatory loci and that as few as 1-3 hypomethylation events per cell are sufficient to activate the hypothesized muscle regulatory locus. Conversion of 10T1/2 cells by 5-azacytidine provides a model for studying regulatory genes involved in cell lineage determination. ?? 1984.},
